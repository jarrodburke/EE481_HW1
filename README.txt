 
Instruction: Write the code and show every intermediate images or plots requested.
1) Reading and manipulating images. 
	 a. Read Winter.png, display in color, display in grayscale
	 b. Plot the black and white histogram and normalize so that the area under the histogram is equal to one.
	 c. Crop any region of 100-by-100 pixels where there is snow on the ground, display, and plot its histogram
	 d. Compare the histograms of the entire image and the subregion by overlaying on top of each other!
	 e. Read Desert.png, convert to black and white image, and display.
	 f. Compare the histograms of (e) and (b) by overlaying them. Can these two images be discriminated by their histogram?
2) Use Lenna Image to (i) convert color to gray scale, (ii) downsample the image (comments on the results) by three-levels to build a pyramid representation.
3) Use the valley, apply image enhancement, and show the histogram before and after histogram equalization. 
4) Use the image called “nature.JPG,” and enhance the image to find something interesting. Plot original and revised histogram. Be creative!
